v0.2.5
- base for LoadBMP256

---------------------
v0.2.4 (10.5.2020)
- reverse pixels methods simplified and unified
- SaveToBMP focused on 24bit version
- SaveToBMP 32bit version prepared, but alpha is not working (wrong BMP header size)

v0.2.3 (10.5.2020)
- BMP file is now saved correctly (both 24/32 bit)

v0.2.2 (10.5.2020)
- fixed errors with alpha drawing
- BMP file is now loaded correctly (both 24/32 bit)
- error is shown, when not correct BMP (width is not multiply of 4, is used)

v0.2.1 (9.5.2020)
- floodFill method
- rechecked some issues with BMP files
- enhanced printing output information from loading BMP process
- new (mostly for debuging) method: ShowPBInfo
- BMP file pixels are loaded using imageSize value, instead of computing it

v0.2.0 (6.5.2020)
- refactored Painter class
	- Painter documentation completed
	- GetPosition moved into the PBImage class
- new alternatives for PBImage.Clear()
- new alternatives for PBImage.LoadFromBMP()
- Tools class created, create int,word values from bytes moved here
- Tool TC method added (creates SColor from color "name")
- new SetColor method+variants for SColor structure
- LoadBMPv2 removed (not used anyway)

v0.1.3 (5.5.2020)

- draw with bitmap with alpha channel (DrawImageAlpha)

v0.1.2 (5.5.2020)
- draw with bitmap (DrawImage)
- new Putpixel variant
- new GetPosition variant

v0.1.1 (4.5.2020)
- painter: circle (ellipse tool)
- painter: polygon (polygon tool)
- tested different aproach to load BMP (refused)

v0.1.0
- reworked structure (int for internal storage),
this can speed up running, because of lesser amount of variable conversions

v0.0.5 (3.5.2020)
- painter: rectangle
- fixed issues with line rendering
- fixed issue with reverse pixel order
- project name change: SpeedPicture

v4 (2.5.2020)
- reworked reverse pixel order
- painter class (putpixel, line, getposition, scolor)

v1 (27.4.2020)
- first attempt
